                    At Datung, we're building Southeast Asia's most innovative microfinance platform - AI-powered, community-driven, and trusted by thousands of underserved small businesses. Backed by Google, Nvidia, and top regional VCs, we're scaling fast, and risk has never been more critical.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    We're looking for a Head of Risk & Compliance to lead credit risk, regulatory compliance, and portfolio integrity as we grow from startup to category-definer.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    This role is more than oversight; it's ownership. You'll shape the guardrails that allow us to move fast without breaking things that matter.

                  <p className="mb-4">We'll be honest â€” Datung is not for everyone.</p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    We're an early-stage, AI-first fintech startup rewriting the rules of microfinance. That means things move fast, break occasionally, and rarely follow a playbook.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-2">But if you're still reading, maybe you're our kind of crazy:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                    <li>Hate slow decisions and legacy systems? Same here.</li>
                    <li>Live for precision, structure, and smooth loan operations? We've got work to do.</li>
                    <li>Thrive in environments where initiative is rewarded? You'll fit right in.</li>
                    <li>Want your work to actually matter? Every loan processed is a lifeline to a real small business.</li>
                    <li>Need polished processes and perfect tools? Not yet. Come help us build them.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    We're obsessed with impact and allergic to BS.<br/>
                    We celebrate wins, own our losses, and back each other up.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If you need full structure, mature systems, or a big team under you from day one, this isn't it.<br/>
                    But if you're excited by building from zero, making tough calls, and ensuring impact at scale, read on.
